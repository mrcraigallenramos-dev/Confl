Understand the previous task context

I accessed the shared Manus session and confirmed it contains a story bible with detailed factions, principles, rituals, and structure. My next step is to analyze this content to extract the key novella beats and chapter structures, which I will then use to generate the bash script for integrating these beats into your repo.

Extract Novella Beats from the Story Bible content

Analyzing the story bible, I identified key factions, principles, and rituals. The content provides detailed beats and chapter structures related to Cadence, Divine Masks, and their factions. My next step is to extract these novella beats systematically and prepare a script to integrate them into your repository. This will ensure the beats are aligned with the chapter structure for seamless story development.

        *   **Cadence / Luthen:** Embodies the will for perfect rhythm and predictable flow. It imposes pattern to overcome chaos, emerging as mortals codify rituals and schedules. Luthen, a ghost from Jhace’s past, leads the Unseen Architects, believing rhythm can overcome chaos.
            *   **Factions & Practices:**
                *   **Unseen Architects:** Design patterns and hidden cycles; they believe events must follow perfect arcs.
                *   **Kitewrights:** Outlaw duelists who “write with wire and wind,” creating shapes that air must obey; they escort people through interference zones.
                *   **Timekeepers:** Clock-smiths and bell keepers who regulate beats; they punish those who break tempo.
            *   **Iconography & Rituals:** Pendulums, spirals, repeating motifs. Funerals involve call-and-response chants. Bell-Tether rituals tie strings to bells to ward off bad hums. Cadence cultists keep metronomes as tokens.






        ### Divine Masks & Follower Factions

        This section details how each principle manifests as a god, the mortal mask it wears, and the factions that worship it. Each faction has its own rituals, slang and hierarchies. Understanding these groups is crucial for political intrigue and conflict.

        #### Purity (Blemo) / Mobel

        *   **Mortal Mask:** Mobel appears as a charismatic, clean-cut evangelist, building a cult of Sanitists. He preaches elimination of suffering by erasing consciousness itself. He offers “mercy” by removing memories and pain.
        *   **Factions & Practices:**
            *   **Sanitists / White-Gloves:** Devotees wear immaculate white gloves and practice ritual cleansing. They advocate erasing pain by erasing consciousness. Gatherings involve ablutions in sterilised rain and communal confession.
            *   **Flensers of White Mercy:** Extremists who remove “impure” flesh; they prove devotion through self-excision. Martyrdom quotas ensure members excise scars.
            *   **Collectors of Dust:** They hoard ash left by purges and snort it as sacrament; they believe inhaling ash binds them to Purity.
            *   **Mercy Kitchens:** Kitchens that serve flavourless gruel as discipline; taste is considered temptation.
        *   **Iconography & Rituals:** Bleached robes, white-rope dances tracing purge boundaries, confession by ablution (standing in sterilised rain to fade memories). Purity’s rituals revolve around denial of sensation and removal of identity.





        #### Form (Xilcore) / Corlex

        *   **Mortal Mask:** Corlex is a cold architect who believes perfect geometry can save the world. He leads the Crystalline Orthodoxy and punishes improvisation.
        *   **Factions & Practices:**
            *   **Crystalline Orthodoxy:** Architects and engineers who enforce geometric purity. They erect axiom stones that realign streets each dawn. Disciples memorise theorems; improvisation is punished.
            *   **Cantors of Axiom:** Clergy-technicians who sing theorems into place through humming chants.
            *   **Line Masons & Stoneseers:** Builders who lay axiom stones and maintain strict alignment; they practice the Rectifier’s Walk funeral ritual.
            *   **Cantor Retaliation Teams:** Strike teams responding when theorems are broken; feared by stallholders.
        *   **Iconography & Rituals:** Right angles, tessellated patterns, proofs carved into walls. Rectifiers carry straight rods as weapon and measuring device. Rituals include proof calligraphy, geometric funerals and Straight-death suicides (marching off cliffs).





        #### Wholeness (Leesa) / Salee

        *   **Mortal Mask:** Salee is a compassionate healer who creates a hive-mind cult. She preaches that peace is found in dissolving the self into the whole.
            *   **Unifieds:** A hive-mind cult where individuals speak in unison and share everything. They believe friction arises from individuality.
