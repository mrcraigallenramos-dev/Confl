This repository contains the complete **meta-framework, forensic evidence, and systemic manipulations** that underpin the *Confluence Chronicles* saga.

## 🔑 Core Meta-Docs

These three documents form the **triangulation system** of the saga:

- **[Series Roadmap](meta/Series%20Roadmap.md)** → Human-readable story architecture.  
- **[The Auditor’s Ledger](meta/Auditor’s%20Ledger.md)** → Detached manipulator’s log.  
- **[Forensic Breadcrumb Index](meta/Forensic%20Breadcrumb%20Index.md)** → Forensic receipts / evidence trail.  

Together, they interlock to maintain narrative and systemic consistency.
