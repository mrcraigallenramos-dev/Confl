THE DEVASTATING FINAL TWIST:
Tiffani's Final Speech (Chapter 450):
"I fell in love with you that first day, watching you fix that broken pump with such gentle determination. Every moment we shared was real. Every kiss, every laugh, every time I held you when the power hurt too much - all real. I saved your life in Series 1 because I couldn't bear to lose you. But I also knew that your grief over losing me would break the seals on the gods and give you the power to end them. I have loved you for decades while orchestrating your destruction. That's the real betrayal - not that I didn't love you, but that I loved you and did this anyway."

The Ultimate Grimdark: Love and manipulation weren't mutually exclusive. The deepest betrayal comes from someone who genuinely cares but chooses their cosmic vision over your wellbeing.

The Blank Page: Perfect Counter-Spark ending - silence, void, the absence of all contradiction and therefore all existence.
