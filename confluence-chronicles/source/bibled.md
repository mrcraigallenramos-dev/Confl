**PHASE 1**
-----------

### **HARD MAGIC SYSTEM - COMPLETE RESONANCE MECHANICS**

The Four Principles (Expanded):

#### **FORM (Crystallization/Structure)**

-   Energy Source: Drawing order from existing patterns

-   Limitations: Cannot create, only organize existing matter/energy

-   Physical Cost: Muscle tension, joint stiffness, eventual
    > calcification

-   Mental Cost: Rigid thinking, loss of creativity, emotional numbness

-   Applications:

    -   Architecture (instant construction from raw materials)

    -   Weapon forging (perfect molecular alignment)

    -   Medical (bone setting, scar tissue organization)

    -   Communication (crystal networks, data storage)

#### **WHOLENESS (Integration/Harmony)**

-   Energy Source: Life force from living beings (consensual or
    > parasitic)

-   Limitations: Requires existing life to manipulate, cannot resurrect

-   Physical Cost: Exhaustion, aging, potential soul fragmentation

-   Mental Cost: Emotional overwhelm from connected consciousness

-   Applications:

    -   Healing (accelerated natural processes)

    -   Empathy networks (shared consciousness)

    -   Agriculture (plant/animal enhancement)

    -   Crowd control (mass emotional influence)

#### **PURITY (Refinement/Essence)**

-   Energy Source: Burning away \"impurities\" to reveal core truth

-   Limitations: Destructive by nature, difficult to control precisely

-   Physical Cost: Fever, dehydration, potential self-immolation

-   Mental Cost: Obsessive perfectionism, inability to compromise

-   Applications:

    -   Metallurgy (perfect alloy separation)

    -   Investigation (burning away lies to reveal truth)

    -   Warfare (targeted destruction of specific materials)

    -   Purification (removing toxins, diseases, curses)

#### **DECAY (Entropy/Transformation)**

-   Energy Source: Accelerating natural breakdown processes

-   Limitations: Cannot control what emerges from destruction

-   Physical Cost: Premature aging, tissue breakdown, organ failure

-   Mental Cost: Depression, nihilism, loss of hope

-   Applications:

    -   Demolition (controlled structural collapse)

    -   Archaeology (rapid excavation through time layers)

    -   Medicine (breaking down tumors, scar tissue)

    -   Intelligence (accelerating information decay in enemies)

Advanced Mechanics:

#### **Resonance Compatibility:**

-   Pure Resonants: 60% of population, single principle

-   Dual Resonants: 35% of population, two compatible principles

-   Tri Resonants: 4% of population, three principles (unstable)

-   Tetra Resonants: 0.9% of population (usually die young)

-   Null Resonants: 0.1% of population (immune to all resonance)

#### **Tethering System:**

-   Personal Tethers: Direct soul connections (max \~10 for most people)

-   Institutional Tethers: Connections through organizations/causes

-   Territorial Tethers: Bonds to specific locations

-   Ancestral Tethers: Inherited connections from bloodline

-   Artificial Tethers: Created through resonance devices

#### **Fathombreak Mechanics:**

-   Trigger Conditions: Tether overload, principle contradiction,
    > extreme trauma

-   Cascade Patterns: How the break spreads through tether networks

-   Survival Factors: Personal resonance strength, tether distribution,
    > external support

-   Aftermath Effects: Resonance scars, principle shifts, soul
    > fragmentation

#### **The World Spine (Cosmic Framework):**

-   Physical Manifestation: Crystalline formations throughout the world

-   Function: Reality\'s \"nervous system\" - maintains principle
    > balance

-   Damage Effects: Local reality distortions, principle dead zones

-   Repair Mechanisms: Natural healing vs. artificial intervention

**ECONOMIC SYSTEMS: THE SOUL ECONOMY**
======================================

**FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE**

    > traded, or used as collateral

--------------------------

### **The Tether Crash:**

When major political figures die or betray alliances, connected tether

Purifier attempts to \"cleanse\" other regions\' economies by destroying
\"corrupted\" trade goods and relationships.

Entropy Cult\'s time manipulation could create economic situations where
goods are sold before they\'re produced or paid for after they\'re
destroyed.

### **The Storm Season:**

**ROMANCE ARCHITECTURE: LOVE ACROSS THE RIFTS**
===============================================

**FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE**
--------------------------

Romance in this world isn\'t just emotional---it\'s magically,
economically, and politically significant. When two people form deep
romantic bonds, they create powerful tethers that can enhance magical

is literally a force that can change the world.

    > connection
