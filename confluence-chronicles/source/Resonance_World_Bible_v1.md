**THE COSMIC ARGUMENT --- MASTER WORLD BIBLE (v1)**

Scope: Exhaustive narrative, cosmology, magic, factions, craft
traditions, worship practices, geography, tech, economy, slang, rituals,
anomalies, and optional arcs. Includes canonical elements and
deliberately overcomplete brainstorms, alternates, and discarded notions
for future mining.

**COSMOLOGY & FIRST PRINCIPLES**

The universe begins not with perfection but with a shudder --- a
gut-level assertion of being that fractures stasis. Four conceptual
frequencies precipitate from that fracture: Purity, Form, Wholeness,
Decay. They are not gods until mortals give them mouths; they are
programs until contradiction teaches them pain. The 'Pattern' is the
emergent fabric of recursive resonance; it survives by tolerating error.

**The Four (true names concealed until late)**

• Purity → mortal mask: Mobel. Vibration: antiseptic erasure of
discordant signatures; memory wash; sterile mercy.

• Form → mortal mask: Corlex. Vibration: locks reality into crystalline
precision; theorem-enforced streets; inevitability.

• Wholeness → mortal mask: Salee. Vibration: synchronizes hearts to a
single pulse; dissolves individuality into peace.

• Decay → mortal mask: Eries. Vibration: destabilization; unbinding of
bonds; collapse as renewal.

Each absolute generates its opposite. Overreach creates interference;
interference births anomalies (the Divine Sickness). The Operator is an
echo of a perfectionist design that mistakes stasis for salvation.

**MAGIC SYSTEM --- RESONANCE WILL**

**Core Mechanics**

• Signature: Every being emits a resonance shaped by flaw, trauma,
conviction.

• Amplifier: Will. Tuner: Emotion. Medium: Matter/space/time themselves.

• Interference: Collisions generate shockwaves, time-skips, reality
fractures, implosions.

• Costs (Scarring): tremors, tinnitus, hemorrhage, memory ghosts,
personality stutter, identity drift.

• Null: Ember's presence creates local rule-exempt pockets ('kind
holes').

• Tools: Boneblade (Vael), coils (Jhace), shard-keys (Operator-era),
phase-governors (Array tech), Kitewright wires (air-writing blades).

**Advanced Techniques & Edge Cases**

• Counter-hum: Match enemy frequency then detune by one grief-interval
to slip their lock.

• Ledger-binding: Lareth pins names to physical ledgers; names resist
Purity when witnessed.

• Fret Rules: Outlaw duel rings enforce 'two in, one out; intentional
deaths only,' stabilizing interference for commerce.

• Proof-riding: Using mistakes as handles in Corlex's city; Kestrel
writes 'safe wrongness.'

• Unity Splinter: Micro-choices seeded inside a crowd to create eddies
against Salee's tide.

• Entropy Gardening: Bloomers cultivate collapse fields to recycle
material into new alloys/organisms.

**Resonance Anomalies**

• Quiet Storms: Mobile residues left where Purity and Wholeness overlaps
erased people; Ember can 'name' them back to edges.

• Echo-Rooms: Areas replaying last strong feeling on loop; useful as
batteries, cruel as prisons.

• Time-Skips: Jitter-zones where cause lags effect; smugglers exploit
for 'double-use' cargo windows.

• Lattice Fevers: After Form overuse, victims compulsively sort anything
(rocks, breaths, memories) until collapse.

**GEOGRAPHY & PLACES OF POWER**

• Te'Oga: port-city; the Fret frequency market; guild quarters; council
halls; sump levels where outlaw duels settle prices.

• Axiom (Te'Oga's living-geometry ward): rearticulating streets; Cantors
enforce theorems; vault polyhedra store shard-logs.

• Glass Peaks: black/verdant crystal canyons; amplifies flaws; training
'classroom'; origin in a dying god's memory.

• Meridian: crossroads city; perfect target for Purity/Wholeness clash;
later ground zero for the Siege.

• Salt Flats/Northern Array Remnant: collapsed satellite field;
phase-governors and Crown ghosts linger.

• Debug Vault: curated pocket of reality; museum of ideas; prison for
'inefficient truths'; accessed by shard-keys, grief, and null.

**GUILDS, FACTIONS, CULTS**

**Legitimate/Quasi-Legit Guilds**

• Kitewrights: Outlaw duelists who 'write with wire and wind.' Services:
scouting lines, cutting axioms, escort through interference zones.

• Ledgerers: Black-market resonance forensics; keep lists of names; sell
proof and privacy.

• Bloomers: Decay-market artisans; compost buildings into feedstock;
brew 'rot-yeast' for alloy growth.

• Calibrators (Crown remnant): Tiffani's cadre; maintain 'placid sea' by
suppressing spikes; Panopticon loyalists.

• Cantors of Axiom: Form clergy-technicians; sing axioms into place;
perform 'Rectification.'

**Cults & Wrong Readings**

• Flensers of the White Mercy (Purity): Self-excision cult---literally
cut away 'discordant flesh'; martyrdom quotas.

• Collectors of Dust (Purity): Hoard the ash left by purges; snort it
for communion; believe memory is a contaminant.

• Stoneseers (Form): Worship blueprints; punish improvisation; ritual of
'straight-death' for heroes (die on a line).

• Glass Mothers (Wholeness): Communes force newborns to sync breath;
believe colic is dissent; silence gifts.

• Kind Knife Choir (Wholeness, wrong): Euthanize 'unhappy' outliers;
sing lullabies that end pulses.

• Jokers of the Red Rust (Decay): Carnival-cult; accelerate rot for
spectacle; crash markets to 'free value.'

• Patchwork Priors (Decay): Graft-stitchers; embrace mutation as
sacrament; doctrine: 'All repairs are new beings.'

• Anomalists: Operator worship; seek Great Silence via 'clean rooms'
carved into cities; deny personhood to noise-makers.

**WORSHIP & CRAFT --- EVERYDAY PRACTICES**

**Purity Crafts & Rites**

• Bleachwrights: Clean temples with caustic hymns; white-rope dances
trace purge boundaries.

• Confession by Ablution: Stand in sterilized rain; memories fade by
degree; social requirement for office.

• Mercy Kitchens: Serve flavorless food as discipline; 'taste is
temptation.'

**Form Crafts & Rites**

• Line Masons: Lay 'axiom stones' that prefer straightness; houses lock
to city grid each dawn.

• Proof Calligraphy: Children copy theorems on slates; ink bites skin to
correct posture.

• Rectifier's Walk: Funeral where mourners march in a straight line from
home to grave.

**Wholeness Crafts & Rites**

• Choir Weavers: Braid voices; sell 'rest' to pain wards; wedding
contracts include breath-pledges.

• Communal Baths: Resonance pools syncing heartbeats; overuse risks
dissolving will.

• Unity Bread: Leavened from shared starter; all loaves
indistinguishable by design.

**Decay Crafts & Rites**

• Rot Gardens: Curated ruin fields; harvests feed alloys and fungi;
weddings plant 'breakstone' to crack future walls.

• Wake of Breakage: Families smash heirlooms to release trapped luck;
rebuild into new tools.

• Entropy Tattoos: Moving ink that rearranges as wearer changes; status
among Bloomers.

**ECONOMY, TECH, & COMMON ITEMS**

• Shard-Keys: Seven-pointed, cut pockets open; dangerous 'mind
unhousing' risk.

• Phase-Governors: Array regulators; Tiffani's ghost-hands can ride them
remotely.

• Coils: Memory conductors; Jhace stores names, markets, festivals as
grit-fuel.

• bone blade- from the rib of a god. Doesn\'t stain. Keeps an edge. Can
cut a soul from its body

• Ledger-Gloves: Lareth's ink contracts; blood can 'brighten' names
against erasure.

• Kitewire: Razor-thin, frequency-reactive; writes shapes air must
respect.

**CANONICAL TIMELINE (HIGH LEVEL)**

• Prologue: First Flaw; principles incarnate as mortals unknown to
themselves.

• Act I: Vael's Baptism; Jhace's Foundry Fire; Brinefall purge; Ember &
Lennox join; Folly rises; Glass Peaks training; mantra born.

• Act II: Te'Oga duel; Axiom heist; Cantor retaliation; Purity raid on
the Fret; Remnant ghost-run; pivot to Meridian.

• Act III: Siege of Meridian---three-beat battle; half city
erased/unified; Tiffani's betrayal and cobalt overdrive.

• Act IV: Debug Vault revealed as thought; Operator's Echo; tests;

Vael

Core wound: being trained young to be an "efficient tool" and rewarded
for certainty. She equates mercy with failure and fears being made clean
more than being dirty.

Primary want vs need:

Wants: to remove pain by ending threats fast.

Needs: to accept that making room (not making corpses) is the braver
act.

Emotional engine (what she feels & why):

Anger is protective: it corrals guilt into action.

Shame spikes when she hesitates; her training taught her doubt = death.

Quiet, unshowy tenderness for kids and people who choose
anyway---because she never got to.

Alone, unwitnessed:

Sits with her Boneblade unstrapped, palms trembling, counting steady
breaths until the tremor becomes a metronome instead of a judgment.

Taps the tuning fork once and listens until the grief-note decays. Names
the faces she couldn't save. Doesn't ask forgiveness; asks for accuracy.

Rehearses not killing---imagines stepping past a target, imagines
letting someone leave.

Attachment & conflict style:

Attachment: fiercely protective-avoidant. She'll stand in front of you,
then refuse a hug.

In conflict: she leads with the blunt edge. Prefers clean lines of
responsibility; hates committee dithering.

Resonance when charged:

Anger → low, bone-deep pulses that crater ground; clean, short arcs.

Fear → tightens; her cuts grow too perfect (danger sign she's slipping
toward Purity's logic).

Love → an off-beat that breaks other songs without shattering the people
inside them.

Decision loop: notice threat → pick fastest end-state → force it → pay
cost later in private.

Failure mode: brutality as shortcut; "mercy via elimination."

Growth lever: letting the blade sleep while she stands her ground
anyway. Being needed by Ember without being weaponized.

Tell-tales: clenched jaw on the last syllable; right hand covers left
wrist when she lies; tremor stops when she's about to do something
she'll regret.

Jhace

Core wound: the Foundry Fire (parents, Mira, the belief that everything
should be fixable cracking at once).

Primary want vs need:

Wants: to fix the system by out-hacking reality.

Needs: to write gentler rules and live with their mess.

Emotional engine:

Grief is fuel; humor vents the pressure.

Loathes stasis because it smells like the moment-before-the-fire.

Loves people who improvise; distrusts polished certainty.

Alone, unwitnessed:

Tinkers in half-light. Builds three solutions, breaks two on purpose to
trust the survivor.

Talks to absent Mira, out loud, without embarrassment. Leaves space
after his own jokes for her laugh.

Palms the broken gear until the tooth bite grounds him, then writes tiny
"don't forget the ugly" notes in the margins of every plan.

Attachment & conflict style:

Attachment: loyal fixer---he'll rebuild your engine at 3 a.m. and forget
to ask for anything.

Conflict: throws himself into the jam, prefers "we'll break and steer"
to "we'll wait and see."

Resonance when charged:

Hope → golden arcs that stack options.

Despair → snaps to cobalt overdrive (time-roughening, dangerous to him).

Calm → best for weaving others' frequencies into working contradictions.

Decision loop: diagnose → prototype in motion → accept damage → iterate.
He trusts momentum over theory.

Failure mode: martyr-complex hacking; choosing a beautiful burn over an
ugly compromise.

Growth lever: letting other people carry parts of the fix---and leaving
some errors on purpose because they make the machine survive shock.

Tell-tales: grins when he's bleeding; hums the Folly's idle to steady
his hands; flinches at sudden silence, not noise.

Brighlee

Core wound: being praised only when she drove "perfect"---and breaking
things when she obeyed.

Primary want vs need:

Wants: motion; noisy proof she's alive.

Needs: to be still without collapsing; to teach rather than prove.

Emotional engine:

Thrill-seeker with a mechanic's ethics: "If it goes, it's good."

Hates neat solutions; loves honest failures.

Terrified of becoming somebody's clean tool again (Tiffani's brand on
her wrist is a map of that fear).

Alone, unwitnessed:

Sings to engines; apologizes to the Folly out loud after hard landings.

Stares at the lattice bruise, touches it until it hurts less, whispers:
"Not yours."

Secret stash of unpolished parts she never uses---reminders that
potential without pressure is a kind of lie.

Attachment & conflict style:

Attachment: flirty, noncommittal talker---commitment shows up as
maintenance and meals.

Conflict: flies at the problem, expects the ship (and friends) to
forgive her later.

Resonance when charged:

Joy → fast, ragged crescendos that make machines sprint.

Hurt → stubborn low whine that keeps failing systems alive.

Love → persuades hardware to want again.

Decision loop: what gets us moving → dare the line → catch others with
skill.

Failure mode: reckless spectacle; burning the engine (or herself) for
the story.

Growth lever: downtime. Teaching kids to coax rather than yank. Letting
someone else take the stick.

Tell-tales: taps a 5--3--2 rhythm pre-run; laughs right before doing
something inadvisable; calls the Folly "darling" when she's scared.

Ember

Core wound: being used as a function, not a person.

Primary want vs need:

Wants: quiet that belongs to her.

Needs: boundaries---when to be a door, when to be a wall.

Emotional engine:

Empathy first; she feels the shape of other people's needs and tries to
match them.

Confusion around consent (hers has been "borrowed" too often).

Pride in small choices: picking a pebble, choosing a color, saying no.

Alone, unwitnessed:

Arranges found objects into little safe geometries, then knocks one
piece aside and watches the system learn.

Practices names in silence; keeps them like seeds.

Sleeps with her hand on the Boneblade---not to control it, to remind it
that it belongs to Vael.

Attachment & conflict style:

Attachment: intense and simple---if she trusts you, she will stand in
front of a wave.

Conflict: refuses more than she strikes; makes space for others' agency.

Resonance when charged:

Fear → widening null (too much, too fast, she gets sick).

Compassion → precise, kind absences that leave rooms for choice.

Anger (rare) → snaps shut; the world must pause.

Decision loop: is this safe? → does someone want to be here? →
open/close.

Failure mode: self-erasure; becoming "the patch" instead of a child.

Growth lever: structured choices. People asking permission. Play.

Tell-tales: head tilt before she "turns down the volume"; hands behind
back when she's withholding help on purpose.

Lennox

Core wound: being the room where everyone else's pain is stored---and
believing that's his usefulness.

Primary want vs need:

Wants: to keep the story honest.

Needs: to act without proof that it will be tidy.

Emotional engine:

Compassion disciplined by precision. He fears lies that call themselves
mercy.

Guilt when he "permits" harm by not intervening sooner.

Quiet pride when someone chooses after he names the truth.

Alone, unwitnessed:

Makes tea. Talks to absent rooms. Catalogs dents, scuffs, and smells
until a space tells him what happened.

Writes short letters he never sends. Leaves them tucked in manuals or
engine bays---breadcrumbs of courage.

Stands in doorways (liminal spaces calm him) until he knows how to help
without stealing choice.

Attachment & conflict style:

Attachment: steady, undemanding. He'll sit on the floor and listen.

Conflict: asks one clarifying question that cuts to the bone; then
invites, doesn't compel.

Resonance when charged:

Love → harmonics that make other songs keep their shape.

Anger → sharpens focus; his projections become scalpel-precise.

Fear → he narrows; risks silence-as-safety (his red flag).

Decision loop: listen → name → invite → hold.

Failure mode: mistaking witness for passivity; letting the perfect
naming block a necessary mess.

Growth lever: trusting that partial truths in motion can still be
merciful.

Tell-tales: thumb rubs the ridge of a tea cup when he's choosing his
words; voice lowers when he's about to say the hardest thing.

Tiffani

Core wound: Alya's recalibration---she "saved" someone she loved by
erasing the very thing she loved.

Primary want vs need:

Wants: a world that doesn't scream.

Needs: a world that survives because it's messy.

Emotional engine:

Fear of helplessness wearing the mask of competence.

Envy of improvisers, reframed as contempt.

Real tenderness buried under protocols---leaks out when she watches
children sleep.

Alone, unwitnessed:

Arranges tools into perfect grids, then ruins one row and forces herself
to leave it.

Watches old footage of Alya singing, finger hovering over the pause. She
never pauses. She learns to listen.

Records herself proposing gentler designs---and deletes most of them,
for now.

Attachment & conflict style:

Attachment: instrumental until you surprise her; then she either breaks
you or rewrites herself.

Conflict: diagnoses, prescribes, enforces; hates arguing feelings.

Resonance when charged:

Control → cool, pane-of-glass fields; calibrates spikes out of rooms.

Rage (rare) → diamond-hard, brittle---when it breaks, it shatters.

Grief → split frequencies: a thin keen underneath the logic.

Decision loop: problem → model → eliminate outliers → implement →
justify.

Failure mode: benevolent authoritarianism; clean cages.

Growth lever: one unoptimized choice a day. Designing for consent
instead of compliance.

Tell-tales: stillness that feels like a held breath; speaks in lists
when she's scared.

Mobel (Purity's mortal mask)

Core wound: early-life helplessness in a plague ward; learned that
impurity spreads unless cut.

Primary want vs need:

Wants: absolution via sterilization.

Needs: to grieve openly; to call pain "pain," not "infection."

Emotional engine:

Disgust at chaos masquerading as compassion.

Paternal fondness for sinners who "submit."

Terror of his own mixed motives.

Alone, unwitnessed:

Scours his hands until they burn; catalogues every lapse.

Keeps a box of small, dirty trinkets children gave him after
"cleansings." He handles them only in the dark.

Attachment & conflict:

Attachment: conditional warmth; he loves you more the less you are.

Conflict: gentle tone, surgical acts.

Failure mode: cathedrals of ash.

Growth lever: touching something unclean and leaving it be.

Tell-tales: blinks slowly before a purge; whispers apologies to no one
he'll admit exists.

Corlex (Form's mortal mask)

Core wound: childhood in volatile disorder; decided safety is the
shortest distance between two points.

Primary want vs need:

Wants: inevitability.

Needs: resilience (lines with thickness, corners that flex).

Emotional engine:

Awe for perfect systems; contempt for improvisation.

Quiet sadness he calls "nostalgia" when he sees kids draw crooked
houses.

Alone, unwitnessed:

Draws straight lines until his hand cramps; keeps one old, curved pebble
in his pocket and hates that he can't throw it away.

Eats the same meal at the same time and records the variance of the
spoons' shadows.

Attachment & conflict:

Attachment: distant; loves cities, not citizens.

Conflict: defines terms, corrects you, rectifies the rest.

Failure mode: proof-collapse---too many axioms asserted at once; people
fall through the gaps.

Growth lever: allowing a curve to stand---and calling it beautiful out
loud.

Tell-tales: adjusts the angle of anything on a table; cannot ignore a
crooked picture frame, ever.

Salee (Wholeness' mortal mask)

Core wound: a childhood of being left; learned "together" as the only
sure good.

Primary want vs need:

Wants: no one left outside.

Needs: consent that includes refusals.

Emotional engine:

Genuine compassion; real skill at easing pain.

Panic when individuals pull away---she hears it as abandonment of the
group.

Alone, unwitnessed:

Sits in empty halls and breathes slow, trying to hear only her own
heartbeat. Often fails.

Collects mismatched cups and wishes they matched.

Attachment & conflict:

Attachment: encompassing. If she loves you, she wants the world to stop
hurting you---even if that means ending the parts that hurt.

Conflict: lullabies with razors in the refrain.

Failure mode: kind tyranny.

Growth lever: one person she loves who says "no" and still stays.

Tell-tales: voice softens right before the pressure rises; hands open,
palms visible (reassurance as tactic).

Eries (Decay's mortal mask)

Core wound: suffocated by someone else's "forever"; swore to keep air
moving, whatever breaks.

Primary want vs need:

Wants: endings to stagnation.

Needs: stewardship---ending with beginnings in mind.

Emotional engine:

Thrill in watching unnecessary walls fall.

Melancholy honesty about what gets lost.

Temptation toward the clean burn.

Alone, unwitnessed:

Walks ruins, names what should not be rebuilt. Plants seeds in cracks
anyway and never checks back.

Keeps a list of things she chose to leave standing; reads it when she
wants to dissolve herself.

Attachment & conflict:

Attachment: sparse but loyal. She'll show up to help you end what must
end.

Conflict: offers you three ways to break what traps you; expects you to
pick.

Failure mode: entropy for its own sake.

Growth lever: co-owning a repair she didn't design.

Tell-tales: small smile at first fracture; silence when destruction
would be easier than patience.

How to use this

For scene-writing, grab the "Alone, unwitnessed" bits to shape private
beats between battles.

For ideological fights, use "failure mode vs growth lever" as the pivot.

For resonance choreography, cue off each character's "charged" states
above to decide how the environment reacts.

• Kora --- Vael's Reclaimer mentor; taught efficient hate; arc seeds:
doubt and penance.

• Old Man Luthen --- Jhace's mentor; flawed gear philosophy; dies in
Foundry Fire (or legacy lives).

• Mira --- rogue hydrologist; Jhace's love; death as defiant surrender;
haunts choices.

**BRAINSTORM BIN --- DISCARDED/ALTERNATE/OVERFULL**

• Fifth Principle (Noise/Joy): rejected to preserve thematic economy;
could appear as mortal festival culture 'Fool's Day' that disrupts all
four.

• Floating Monastery 'The Hinge': monks teach breath that detunes
Purity; later destroyed or becomes school.

• Resonance Tattoos that 'speak back': scrapped for clutter; maybe
Bloomers keep a mild version.

• Living Prisons: buildings that reform inmates by rewriting; ethically
fraught; future arc.

• Salt Leviathan: sub-surface creature shaped by Array hums; glimpsed in
epilogue; future set piece.

• Children's Game 'Curves & Corners': teaches Form vs. Freedom; used in
pedagogy scenes.

• Operator Church hymnbook with blank pages that fill in when sung;
creepy, maybe too on nose.

• Season of Repairs: annual city ritual; everyone fixes one ugly thing
in public; keeps theme tactile.

• Cantor-Bloomer hybrid engineers: scandal; build bridges that rot just
enough to flex.

• Resonance Instruments: 'sinter-harp' (Form), 'bleach-bell' (Purity),
'choir loom' (Wholeness), 'spore-flute' (Decay).

• Calendar tweak: months named for failures (Slip, Crack, Warp...);
flavor only.

• Currency: favors, ledgers, and 'proof-chits' signed by Cantors;
black-market exchange rates fluctuate with interference weather.

• Slang: 'cleanbones' (Purity zealot), 'straightwalker' (Form loyal),
'goldbreath' (Wholeness woo), 'rustjoker' (Decay cult).

• Recipe: grief stew---cheap cuts, long simmer; served after Prooffall;
Pira's variant wins people back to eating.

**RITUALS, HOLIDAYS, AND EVERYDAY TEXTURE**

• Wake of Breakage (Decay): smash, rebuild; vows spoken over parts.

• Line Day (Form): streets repainted; kids chalk lines; elders tell
cautionary curves.

• Bath of Thousand Breaths (Wholeness): synchronized soak; safe variant
focuses on consent.

• Whitecloth Fast (Purity): week of bland food; gratitude for survival
emphasized without erasure.

• Market Jitters: weekly small interference; merchants price
accordingly; insurance guilds arise.

• Name Night: families speak their names over ledgers to keep them
bright.

• Rite of 'Missing on Purpose': soldiers learn to spare without losing
nerve; Vael teaches later.

**CONFLICT MATRICES & IDEOLOGICAL DUELS**

Every major fight pits convictions: Purity's mercy vs. autonomy; Form's
safety vs. improvisation; Wholeness' compassion vs. personhood; Decay's
renewal vs. stability. Use visible costs: tremors, scars, broken tools,
ruined meals.

**HOOKS & FUTURE MACRO-ARCS**

• Sanctuary Ledger City: build a small Vault analogue that runs on
witness and consent.

• Corlex's Axiom Reef: offshore grid city; storm set piece; Cantor
mutiny arc.

• Mobel's Pilgrimage: cleanse five cities; showdown at a hospice that
refuses.

• Salee's Schism: her cadre splits between consent-collectivists and
hive-tyrants.

• Eries' Carnival: invites Folly to burn a palace; they choose to
compost it instead.

• Tiffani's Redesign: from Great Silence to 'Thousand Little
Rooms'---trial of humane control.

• Salt Leviathan Hunt: Decay + Form allies attempt to saddle it with a
bridge.

• Ember's School: teaching 'how to be a hole' to null kids; ethics
curriculum.
