# After the Lever / The Quiet Bells

**Series:** The Broken Tone - The Hard-Won Redemption
**Novella:** 6.1

## Description

Aethelgard is a world of muted resonances. Tiffani and Jhace, their memories fragmented, are drawn to each other by an inexplicable sense of familiarity. They work in parallel, each encounter sparking a faint, unsettling echo of a past they can't quite grasp. The focus will be on the poignant struggle of rediscovery.
