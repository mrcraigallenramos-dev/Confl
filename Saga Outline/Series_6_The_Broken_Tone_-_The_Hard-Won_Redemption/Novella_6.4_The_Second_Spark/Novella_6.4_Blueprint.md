# The Second Spark

**Series:** The Broken Tone - The Hard-Won Redemption
**Novella:** 6.4

## Description

Tiffani and Jhace embark on a perilous journey to the Heresy Engine. Its activation is a climactic event, a Second Spark that sends a wave of re-harmonizing energy. The process is not a perfect restoration but a re-balancing, creating a new, imperfect harmony. The emotional cost will be palpable.
