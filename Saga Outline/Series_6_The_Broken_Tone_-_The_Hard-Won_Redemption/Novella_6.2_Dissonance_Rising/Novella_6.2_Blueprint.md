# Dissonance Rising

**Series:** The Broken Tone - The Hard-Won Redemption
**Novella:** 6.2

## Description

As the World Spine recovers, so do their fragmented memories, often painful and discordant. They struggle to reconcile their past with their present, leading to renewed tension. New dissonances emerge, emphasizing that simply suppressing the Rot is not enough; true healing requires re-harmonization.
