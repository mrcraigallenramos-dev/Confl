## Description

The conflict in Ferris reaches its bloody climax. Lysandra's definitive betrayal occurs, where she sacrifices a character (perhaps Toren, or a similar figure) for political power, ascending to the 'Dust Throne.' Her cold, calculating choice directly impacts Tiffani and Jhace, forcing them to confront the devastating consequences of ambition over love. This betrayal will be presented with a sense of tragic inevitability, rooted in her humanized motivations.
