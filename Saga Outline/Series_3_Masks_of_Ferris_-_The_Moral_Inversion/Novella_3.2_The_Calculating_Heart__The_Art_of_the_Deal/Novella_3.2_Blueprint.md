# The Calculating Heart / The Art of the Deal

**Series:** Masks of Ferris - The Moral Inversion
**Novella:** 3.2

## Description

Tiffani and Jhace make difficult bargains. Lysandra's use of romance as a weapon will be explicitly shown, perhaps involving a character close to Tiffani and Jhace, further complicating their relationship and emphasizing the theme of love being weaponized for political gain.
