# Harmonic Convergence / The Weight of the Crown

**Series:** Masks of Ferris - The Moral Inversion
**Novella:** 3.4

## Description

The assassination plot fails, and Tiffani and Jhace are caught in the crossfire. This novella represents a moment of false hope, where a seemingly positive development or alliance ultimately leads to further conflict and deeper betrayal, mirroring the growing chasm between Tiffani and Jhace. Quinlan's fracturing will become more pronounced here.
