# Novella 1.2 — The Resonance Duet (Blueprint)

## Core Theme
Two fragile people learning to harmonize; intimacy becomes power — and power is unstable.

## Core Ironic Seed
The duet they craft to save others is the same pattern Tiffani is engineering to make Jhace a controllable, high-output resonant.

## Synopsis
After the turbine rescue, Jhace and Tiffani are hailed as saviors. They lean on each other, testing small harmonizations that calm panic and heal wounds. The duet grows intoxicating — emotionally (sex, dependency, praise) and metaphysically (increasingly powerful Soulpulse effects). Political and logistical pressures push them to scale their methods. Subtle anomalies — secret logs, odd `phase_delta` markers, and offhand tech phrases — begin to accumulate into an investigative breadcrumb trail. The duet succeeds, but the cost becomes clearer; Jhace craves the fix, Tiffani keeps a clinical distance, and the Debug Vault access is authorized — a path that leads to the Recalibration and the Recalibrate detonation in 1.5.

## Forensic Strings to Seed & Reuse
- `phase_delta = –3.00`
- `phase_delta: +0.03 composite_anom [Jhace/Tiffani] timestamp 00:42:11`
- `experimental/wholeness_duet/01`
- `debug_vault: remote_override approved`
- `phase_bias = +0.97`

(Reserve `phase_delta: +0.03 composite_anom...` for major reveals later.)

## POV / Tone / Magic Notes
- POV: Primarily limited 3rd through **Jhace**. Keep Tiffani's interiority opaque.
- Tone: Gritty, intimate, morally ambiguous.
- Magic: Physical, visceral — ringing, metallic taste, breath rhythms, ear-bleeds, pressure.
