# Novella 1.1 — The First Hum (Blueprint)

**Series**: Series 1 — Echoes of the God Shock  
**Word target**: 8k–18k (novella); chapter targets noted below.

## Core Ironic Seed
The teamwork and apparent compassion that first binds Tiffani and Jhace is actually Tiffani’s first field test of a deliberately manipulated resonance — the earliest step in turning Jhace into the instrument of her long con.

## Synopsis
A city-core turbine collapses into a resonance cascade — the “Divine Sickness.” Jhace, a gifted but unstable mechanic, and Tiffani, a seemingly compassionate resonance expert, are the only people able to cooperate close enough to stabilize the machine. Their attempts are messy, intimate, and costly; the joint resonance stabilizes the turbine but leaves them physically and spiritually marked. In the chaos a lowly homeless man receives a datapass by accident — the first seed that will grow into Mobel. Forensic breadcrumbs hint that Jhace’s pulse and Tiffani’s were already composite during the rescue; Jhace senses a cold geometric lattice under Tiffani’s warmth but files it away.

## Interludes
- **Mobel Seed (Interlude A)**: A homeless man is handed a datapass/credentials by a dying official during the crisis. He accepts the mistaken identity and slips away — the Auditor watches.
- **Salee & Eries (Interlude B)**: Two separate vignettes show a healer and a decay/guardian figure performing miraculous acts and gaining followers; the Auditor quietly notes their emergent talents.
- **Epilogue**: Four mortals awaken to their true names: Xilcore, Blemo, Leesa, Seeri — hinting at mortal-ascension and the wider scale of the problem.

## Forensic Breadcrumbs (use exact strings later)
- `phase_delta: +0.03 composite_anom [Jhace/Tiffani] timestamp 00:42:11`
- A diagnostic log with a faint composite resonance trace (timestamped during the synchronized resonance).
- A security feed of an aide pressing a datapass into a homeless man's hand (Mobel seed).
- A tech in the control room mutters "recalibrate" — later missing / hospitalized; a background access ping touches the Debug Vault control line with a nonstandard authority header (auditor/anon-000).

## Key Characters (for this novella)
- **Jhace** — 17–25 yo mechanic; practical, grease-streaked; conservative motion; sensitive to resonance; faint golden leaks from palms; ears can bleed under strain.
- **Tiffani** — mid-20s–30s; immaculate, calm, neutral-scented; appears warm but with occasional cold geometric flickers at the edge of her healing light. Keep her interiority opaque to the reader.
- **Mobel (interlude)** — dirty, overlooked; accepts passcodes accidentally and steps into a new identity.
- **Salee** / **Eries** (interlude seeds) — brief vignettes of emergent power; will later reveal true names.

## Setting & Tone
**Location**: Soot-lined industrial quarter; turbine cathedral beneath the city (claustrophobic, metallic, humming).  
**Tone**: Gritty, visceral, urgent; grimdark where small acts of compassion can have catastrophic hidden costs.

## Writing Guidance
- **POV**: Limited third-person focused mainly through Jhace for emotional anchoring. Use neutral/field POVs for opening hook and interludes.
- **Tiffani**: remain opaque—reader trusts her because the narration does, but interior access is limited.
- **Magic**: Ground in physical sensations (metallic taste, ringing, pressure, breath cadence) rather than abstract jargon.
- **Breadcrumb hygiene**: reuse exact strings and small, concrete artifacts (a datapass, a log line, the word "recalibrate") to tie future revelations together.

# Chapter Beats (compact)

Total target: 8k–18k across ~10 chapters + interludes/epilogue. Chapter word targets included.

## Chapter 1 — “The Low Note” (Hook) — 800–1,200 words
Open in medias res: turbine alarms, hum rearranging teeth, systems failing. Ground the danger with a junior mechanic/EMT POV. Forensic breadcrumb: camera feed of aide with datapass (Mobel seed).

## Chapter 2 — “Aftershock” (Introduce Jhace) — 800–1,100
Jhace's habits, resonance reaction, private ritual (tap-code), failed fix, Tiffani radioed in.

## Chapter 3 — “Arrival of Calm” (Introduce Tiffani) — 900–1,200
Tiffani enters, small healing feats, meets Jhace, suggests joint sync. Foreshadow: tech requests "calibration patch."

## Chapter 4 — “Failures” (Rising stakes) — 900–1,100
Several failed sync attempts; bodily toll; tech slips "recalibrate." Composite log blips recorded.

## Interlude A — “A Slate for a Stranger” (Mobel seed) — 250–400
Dying official gives datapass to homeless man; Auditor watches; name sticks as Mobel.

## Chapter 5 — “Bracing the Wheel” (Climax setup) — 700–1,000
Preparation for synchronized attempt; breathing exercises; tech freezes and mutters; last-minute lock-in.

## Chapter 6 — “Breath and Lattice” (Synchronized Resonance — centerpiece) — 1,300–1,800
Detailed sensory resonance scene. The turbine stabilizes; both marked physically (ears bleed, memory fog). Exact forensic log created: `phase_delta: +0.03 composite_anom [Jhace/Tiffani] timestamp 00:42:11`.

## Interlude B — “Ripples” (Salee & Eries seeds) — 350–550
Two short vignettes showing parallel emergences elsewhere; Auditor catalogues notes.

## Chapter 7 — “Praise and Blood” (Aftermath) — 700–900
Public acclaim, political opportunists, a grieving family. Security feed surfaces showing Mobel's slate exchange; composite log quietly pulled by a tech.

## Chapter 8 — “The Cold Edge” (Foreshadow long con) — 600–800
Subtle unnerving Tiffani details: clinical ritual in a "room that is not a room"; tech missing/hospitalized; a non-user ID accessed the log.

## Chapter 9 — “Echoes” (Set-up for series arc) — 600–800
Tiffani summoned away; Debug Vault ping with strange signature; Jhace is left with tap-code and doubt.

## Chapter 10 — “Falling Quiet” (Tag / Pre-1.3 hook) — 800–1,200
Quiet domestic: packing for Debug Vault; consent forms; final forensic ping; final tap-code exchange.

## Epilogue — “A Name Made” — 250–400
Auditor marks Mobel “seed accepted”; four faint new notes registered on her panel — the world tilts.

## Notes / Tone guidance
- Romance & grit: include sex and emotional vulnerability, but leave ambiguity about whether it's tactical or genuine.
- Keep Tiffani's inner life opaque; Jhace remains the reader's empathic center.
- Maintain breadcrumb discipline: exact strings, minor details, and extracted logs will be reused to connect future books.
- Pacing: place the resonance centerpiece (Chapter 6) at the emotional peak; surround with faster scenes for momentum.
