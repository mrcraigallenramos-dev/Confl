# The Spine Speaks / Echoes of the First Spark

**Series:** The Hollowing - The Unreliable Truth
**Novella:** 5.2

## Description

They uncover ancient records and prophecies hinting at a primordial conflict. Jhace reconstructs shattered artifacts, while Tiffani connects with ancient resonants. This novella marks a significant 'World revelation,' where the true history and cosmology of Aethelgard are unveiled, and the World Spine itself seems to communicate its distress, but through a lens of potential unreliability.
