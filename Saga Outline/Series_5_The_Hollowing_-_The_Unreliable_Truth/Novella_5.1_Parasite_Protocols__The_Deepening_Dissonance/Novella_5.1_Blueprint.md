# Parasite Protocols / The Deepening Dissonance

**Series:** The Hollowing - The Unreliable Truth
**Novella:** 5.1

## Description

The Rot accelerates its spread. Tiffani and Jhace discover the Rot is a conscious, malevolent entity. This novella introduces the emergence of cosmic horror, perhaps through the discovery of 'Parasite Protocols' that reveal the Rot's true, insidious nature and its connection to a deeper, more ancient evil. Quinlan's fracturing will become more severe here, making his narration increasingly unreliable.
