**Novella:** 5.5

## Description

In the aftermath, Tiffani and Jhace find themselves in a desolate, hollowed-out world. Toren's ultimate betrayal occurs, where he pulls the Lever, sacrificing Lysandra (or a similar character) and damning billions for species survival. His choice, while pragmatic, is a profound act of betrayal that reverberates through the world, creating the 'Hollowgate.' Tiffani and Jhace's fragmented memories and emotional echoes are a direct consequence of this event, setting the stage for their long journey of rediscovery, but the full truth of Toren's motivations will be subtly revealed.
