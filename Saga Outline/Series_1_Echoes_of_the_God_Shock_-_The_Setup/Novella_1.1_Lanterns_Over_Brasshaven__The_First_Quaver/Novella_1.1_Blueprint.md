# Lanterns Over Brasshaven / The First Quaver

**Series:** Echoes of the God Shock - The Setup
**Novella:** 1.1

## Description

Alara's betrayal motivation is enhanced: she discovered a prophecy showing Tiffani and Jhace will cause the world's end. Her betrayal is an attempt to prevent this prophecy, making her a tragic figure driven by a desperate, if misguided, belief that she is saving the world. This creates a powerful moral ambiguity, forcing the reader to question whether her actions, though harmful, were justified by her perceived necessity. Quinlan's early memory gaps or subtle influences will begin here.
